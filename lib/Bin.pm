=head1 Metagenomic Community Bin

A I<community bin> is a set of one or more contigs from a set of metagenomic samples. Multiple samples
are combined to produce a single set of contigs, and the contigs are then divided into bins according
to which original organism they came from. Thus, organizing metagenomic contigs into bins is a way
of separating genomes out of metagenomes.

The community bin object contains the contig IDs but not their contents. Instead, it contains information
about the contig contents that can be used to decide if bins should be combined or kept apart. The basic
binning algorithm starts with a single contig in each bin and then combines the ones that belong together.

This object contains the following fields.

=over 4

=item contigs

Reference to a list of L<Bin/Contig> objects for the contained contigs.

=item refGenomes

Reference to a sorted list of genome IDs, consisting of all the reference genomes sufficiently close to one or more of the
contigs in the bin.

=item uniProts

Reference to a hash mapping each universal protein role ID to a count of the number of times the role is found in the
bins.

=item taxonID

If present, the proposed taxonomy ID for the bin.

=item name

If present, the proposed genome name for the bin.

=item domain

If present, the domain for the bin.

=item gc

If present, the genetic code for the bin.

=back

=head2 Bin Exchange Format

A bin containing a single contig can be read from a tab-delimited file. The file will contain five records, as follows

=over 4

=item 1

The contig ID followed by the contig length and the mean coverage.

=item 2

The close reference genome IDs.

=item 3

The IDs of the universal roles found in the contig.

=back

Note the assumption that each universal role only occurs once per contig. In addition, a file can contain multiple
single-contig bins that can be read sequentially as follows.

    my @contigs;
    open(my $ih, "<$fileName");
    while (! eof $ih) {
        push @contigs, Bin->new_from_file($ih);
