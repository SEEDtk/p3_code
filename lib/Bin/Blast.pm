=head1 Blast Analysis Object

This object creates a BLAST database for a community sample. Several methods are provided for doing different
types of BLASTing against it. The query sequences will be proteins, and the sample is DNA, so the
tool used will be C<tblastn>.

When the query sequences are created, the comment field for each sequence will be the ID of its functional
assignment. This can be used to determine whether or not a universal role has been hit.

The fields of this object are as follows.

=over 4

=item workDir

Name of the working directory to contain intermediate and data files.

=item blastDb

Name of a BLAST database containing the sample contigs.

=item priv

Privilege level for computing the functions of the feature. The default is C<1>.

=item maxE

The maximum acceptable E-value. The default is C<1e-5>.

=item defaultRole

The default universal role.

=item gap

The maximum permissible gap between BLAST hits that are to be merged. BLAST hits on the same contig in the same
direction that are closer than this number of base pairs are merged into a single hit. The default is C<100>.

=item minlen

The minimum fraction length for a BLAST hit. A BLAST hit that matches less than this fraction of a protein's
length will be discarded. This is done after the gap-merging (see C<gap>).

=item silent

If TRUE, no status messages will be written.

=back

=head2 Special Methods

=head3 new

    my $blaster = Bin::Blast->new($workDir, $contigFasta, %options);

Create a BLAST database for the sample contigs.

=over 4

=item shrub

The L<Shrub> object for accessing the database, or C<undef> if universal roles are not being processed.

=item workDir

Name of the working directory to contain intermediate files.

=item contigFasta

Name of the FASTA file containing the sample contigs.

=item options

A hash of options. These include

=over 8

=item priv

Privilege level for computing the functions of the feature. The default is C<1>.

=item maxE

The maximum acceptable E-value. The default is C<1e-50>.

=item gap

The maximum permissible gap between BLAST hits that are to be merged. BLAST hits on the same contig in the same
direction that are closer than this number of base pairs are merged into a single hit. The default is C<100>.

=item minlen

The minimum fraction length for a BLAST hit. A BLAST hit that matches less than this fraction of a protein's
length will be discarded. This is done after the gap-merging (see C<gap>). The default is C<0.50>.

If TRUE, no status messages will be written.

=head3 MergeMatch

    my $flag = $blaster->MergeMatch(\%contigs, $match);

Store the location of a hit against a contig. The incoming hash should contain a list of hit locations for a specific
query sequence, keyed by contig (subject) ID. The incoming match should be located to the right of all previous hits. This
is a very specialized function that helps us to merge adjacent hits into a single hit.

=over 4

=item contigs

Reference to a hash keyed on contig ID that maps each to a list of L<BasicLocation> objects for hits.

=item match

An L<Hsp> object representing a new hit.

=item RETURN

Returns TRUE if the hits were merged, else FALSE.
